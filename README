This updates the newpagetmplate plugin to handle the new Events for Templates.
It handles both COMMON_PAGE_FROMTEMPLATE (implemented 2010-03-10) and 
COMMON_PAGETPL_LOAD, which replaces it (2011-02-03).

It does not support HTML_PAGE_FROMTEMPLATE, which preceds both of the above.
So, if you are using a distro of Dokuwiki which pre-dates 2010-03-10, then
you must use the original version linked to on the Dokuwiki newpagetemplate plugin
page.
